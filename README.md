# Monte_Carlo_Statistics
This repository explores probability and statistics through Monte Carlo simulations. It includes solutions to statistical problems using Python and Jupyter Notebook, covering probability distributions, expected values, and algorithm comparisons. All results are validated via theoretical analysis and computational experiments.
