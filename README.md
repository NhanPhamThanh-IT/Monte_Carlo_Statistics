## Introduction
Monte Carlo simulations rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. This repository provides various scripts and tools to help you perform Monte Carlo simulations and analyze the results.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Monte_Carlo_Statistics.git
cd Monte_Carlo_Statistics
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
The repository includes several scripts for different types of Monte Carlo simulations. Below is a basic example of how to run a simulation:

```python
import monte_carlo

# Define your simulation parameters
num_simulations = 1000
parameters = {
    'mean': 0,
    'std_dev': 1
}

# Run the simulation
results = monte_carlo.run_simulation(num_simulations, parameters)

# Analyze the results
monte_carlo.analyze_results(results)
```

## Examples
You can find detailed examples and use cases in the `examples` directory. Each example includes a description of the problem, the simulation setup, and the analysis of the results.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions to improve the repository. If you have any suggestions or improvements, please create a pull request or open an issue.
